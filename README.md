Scenario
A global research institution is studying the impact of climate change across different regions. They need a centralized system to track key climate indicators, monitor extreme weather events, and analyze their economic and infrastructural impact.

Business Problem
The organization faces challenges in:
Tracking Climate Trends – Data is scattered across multiple sources, making it difficult to analyze temperature variations, air quality, and precipitation patterns over time.
Generating Reports Efficiently – Researchers rely on manual reporting, leading to delays in decision-making.
Assessing Climate Risks – There is no structured way to analyze how climate events impact infrastructure and the economy in different regions.
To address these issues, I am going to develop a data-driven climate monitoring solution with automated reporting and real-time visualization, ensuring quick access to insights for informed decision-making.

Climate Change dataset column descriptions:
Metadata Columns:
Record ID
•	A unique identifier assigned to each individual climate data record.
Date
•	The specific date when the climate observation was recorded.
Geographic Columns:
Country
•	The nation where the climate data was collected.
City
•	The specific urban location where the data was gathered.
Climate and Environmental Metrics:
Temperature (°C)
•	Measurement of the ambient air temperature in degrees Celsius.
Humidity (%)
•	The amount of water vapor present in the air, expressed as a percentage.
Precipitation (mm)
•	The total amount of rainfall or water equivalent measured in millimeters.
Air Quality Index (AQI)
•	A numerical scale that indicates the level of air pollution and potential health risks.
Extreme Weather Events
•	Significant and unusual meteorological occurrences such as hurricanes, heatwaves, or droughts.
Classification and Contextual Columns:
Climate Classification (Koeppen)
•	A scientific system for categorizing global climate types based on temperature and precipitation patterns.
Climate Zone
•	A broad classification of the ecological climate characteristics of a specific region.
Biome Type
•	A large-scale biological community is defined by its distinctive plant and animal species and environmental conditions.
Meteorological Columns:
Heat Index
•	A combined measure of air temperature and relative humidity represents how hot it actually feels.
Wind Speed
•	The rate of air movement measured at the location.
Wind Direction
•	The compass direction from which the wind is blowing.

Season
•	The specific time of year when the data was collected.
Impact and Vulnerability Columns:
Population Exposure
•	The number of people is potentially affected by the observed climate conditions.
Economic Impact Estimate
•	A monetary valuation of the potential economic consequences related to climate conditions.
Infrastructure Vulnerability Score
•	A numerical rating that assesses the potential risk and susceptibility of infrastructure to climate-related challenges.
